# Pal.Prototype
This is a clunky design as of now. I'd like some help cleaning it up; erasing the divisions and opening it up for a sleeker design.
Please check out the Readme file for more details.



I'm looking for help with the following:

    -Erasing divisions
    -Creating a more modern design
    -Creating more dominant menus with drop-down features
    -Anything else you feel may help out a young developer
     in the early stages of learning
     
     
     



Thank you for any help you can give. It really does help carve my path to a better future.
